This application is written in the ReactJS and Vite for Code compiling and bundling. I've used React Router for routing and Zustand for state management, TailwindCSS and MUI for styling and pre-built components.


## Installation Instructions
Run the following commands to setup and run Frontend Server
'pnpm install'
'pnpm run dev'

Runnning JSON-Server to serve dummy JSON
'json-server --watch db.json --port 8000'

### Make sure you have both Frontend and JSON-Server running together to tryout CRUD operations

NOTE:
1) As the images are being fetched from third party site, so currently there is no feature added to upload image for new restaurant.
2) Search Functionality is something that is planned for further iterations.
